Right after, and without the need of being silent, the program will tell you the exact title of the song you were listening to.The database of the program recognizes songs from Kanye West to Frank Sinatra or Spice Girls. Nothing or almost nothing escapes the app, thanks to its huge music database.Shazam is quite useful for music lovers, because you can often find yourself in a situation where you hear a song that you don't recognize. So with a simple movement, you place your phone close to the source of the sound to find out the title of the song and listen to it as much as you want.</p><hr></td>
